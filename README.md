# Interview Ready

The goal of this project is to prepare software engineers for coding interviews and give meaningful direction in where they should spend their preparation time.

## Readiness Criteria

If you are ready for an interview then you should be able to solve a medium to hard problem in the general time window that an interview gives you. Online assessments can be merciless and require 100% passing, but give you potentially more time. In-person interviews allow you to talk to a person and they may accept an unfinished solution that was trending to success. Some companies may ask easy questions, but this tool is designed to prepare you for a broad range of software engineer positions.

## What It Does

Interview Ready is a Chrome extension that watches your LeetCode progress and gives you a rough sense of where you stand on each key interview topic — arrays, dynamic programming, graphs, and so on. It's a heuristic, not a guarantee: being "ready" here means you've been practicing a topic consistently, not that you'll ace every question. But it's a useful signal for where to focus next.

- **Per-topic practice scores** so you can see at a glance which topics you've been working and which have gone cold
- **Smart suggestions** that point you toward your least-practiced areas first
- **Date-range filtering** to see how your practice looks over the last 7, 30, or 120 days
- **One-click practice** buttons that take you straight to a problem on LeetCode

Everything syncs automatically in the background whenever you visit LeetCode. No setup, no API keys, no extra accounts.

## Getting Started

1. Install the extension from the Chrome Web Store (or load it unpacked from `dist/`)
2. Log in to [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com)
3. Click the Interview Ready icon in your toolbar
4. Your readiness dashboard appears — start practicing!

## Data and Privacy

All data stays within the extension on your machine. The only network calls are to LeetCode's own API — the same calls your browser makes when you use the site normally. Nothing is sent anywhere else.

## For Developers

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for architecture details, build instructions, and how to run tests.
